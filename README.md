> **FlamelingBets** is a betting platform that allows players to place bets in the BEP-20 tokens $0X222 and 0X237. These tokens are Flameling Dividend Tokens and part of the EARN Ecosystem. Currently, the bets are placed manually by sending tokens of each to the corresponding wallets. The site automatically displayes the placed bets amounts and odds. An admin panel allows admins to udpate title, betting options, date, and current state of the teams. Those paramterers are stored in a Postgres Database. The Website and Postgres DB were deployed on Vercel.
